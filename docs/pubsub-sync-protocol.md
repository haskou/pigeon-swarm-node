# Pub/sub synchronization protocol

## Identity publications

`identities.v1.identity.was_created` and
`identities.v1.identity.was_updated` include the exact
`externalIdentifier` CID produced by the signed publication. Consumers fetch
and validate that candidate directly against the event aggregate identity and
its previous-version chain. They must not resolve the event through a DHT
routing record: OrbitDB metadata is the canonical discovery index.

The remaining attributes describe the published identity metadata:
`handle`, `networkIds`, `previousExternalIdentifier`, and `version`.

## Private relay records

Private relay records use two gossipsub topics derived from the private network
key: `pigeon-swarm.private-relay-records.v1.<scope>` for encrypted records and
the same topic with `.request` appended for record requests. A node subscribes
to the record topic, publishes an empty request payload, and an active relay
replies on the record topic with its current encrypted record.

The request and reply are node-to-node transport messages. They have no
frontend consumer and never use IPNS or public IPFS content blocks. Relay
providers may announce a synthetic CID in the public Kademlia DHT so another
node can locate and connect to them; the CID is a discovery key without a block
payload. The encrypted relay record itself remains on the scoped gossipsub
topic.

The public relay-record connection has no HTTP or Bitswap block brokers and
uses ephemeral blockstore/datastore instances. It still provides Kademlia,
gossipsub and circuit-relay transport. IPFS blocks transferred through a
private `/p2p-circuit` stream are exchanged by its endpoint nodes and are not
retained by the public relay.

## Identity presence leases

`presence.v1.identity_presence.was_updated` replicates ephemeral presence over
the domain-event pub/sub transport. It is never persisted in OrbitDB or IPFS.

Each event identifies the lease owner with `ownerNodeId`. Nodes keep leases by
`(identityId, ownerNodeId)`, ignore an older snapshot only within that same
pair, and select the newest connected lease when serving presence reads.
Every authenticated client heartbeat publishes a fresh snapshot, even when the
derived status has not changed.

Only the owner node may publish the transition of its lease to `disconnected`.
Other nodes derive that transition in their local in-memory copy after the
heartbeat timeout. This prevents one node from expiring a still-active lease
owned by another node.

Selected status and custom message use `preferenceUpdatedAt`, which changes only
when the user updates those preferences. Reads merge the newest preference into
the selected live lease. A later heartbeat with an older preference therefore
cannot override `busy`, `invisible`, or a custom message selected on another
node.

The event attributes are:

```json
{
  "identityId": "<identityId>",
  "ownerNodeId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001",
  "preferenceUpdatedAt": 1770000000000,
  "selectedStatus": "available",
  "status": "available",
  "customMessage": "Building the swarm",
  "lastHeartbeatAt": 1770000000000,
  "lastActivityAt": 1770000000000,
  "updatedAt": 1770000000000,
  "networkIds": ["<networkId>"]
}
```

`customMessage`, `lastHeartbeatAt`, `lastActivityAt`, and `networkIds` may be
absent. `identityId`, `ownerNodeId`, `preferenceUpdatedAt`, `selectedStatus`,
`status`, and `updatedAt` are required.

## Call participant leases

`calls.v1.participant_lease.was_updated` replicates ephemeral call membership
connectivity without writing heartbeat timestamps to OrbitDB. Leases are keyed
by `(callId, participantIdentityId, ownerNodeId)`, allowing a direct call to be
created on one node while another participant joins and renews from a different
node.

Every heartbeat publishes a connected snapshot. After the timeout, all nodes
remove their stale local copy, but only the owner publishes the disconnected
snapshot. Durable call documents retain call lifecycle and participant history;
they contain no heartbeat timestamp.

```json
{
  "callId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440010",
  "connectionChanged": true,
  "mediaConnectionsChanged": true,
  "mediaConnections": [
    {
      "localCandidateType": "relay",
      "protocol": "udp",
      "relayProtocol": "udp",
      "relayUrl": "turn:relay.example:3478?transport=udp",
      "remoteCandidateType": "relay",
      "remoteIdentityId": "<remoteIdentityId>",
      "state": "connected"
    }
  ],
  "participantIdentityId": "<identityId>",
  "participantIds": ["<creatorIdentityId>", "<participantIdentityId>"],
  "ownerNodeId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440012",
  "networkId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440011",
  "lastHeartbeatAt": 1770000000000,
  "status": "connected"
}
```

Media connection reports are replaced on every participant heartbeat. They
describe the selected ICE path observed by the browser for each remote
participant. A report change is forwarded to participant WebSockets; identical
heartbeat snapshots remain node-to-node only. Reports are cleared when the
lease disconnects and are never persisted in OrbitDB/IPFS.

## Call signal delivery

`calls.v1.signal.sent` carries ephemeral WebRTC offers, answers and ICE
candidates. Every node subscribes to the event so a recipient connected to a
different node receives it immediately. The event is routed only through the
call network selected by `networkId`; it is never persisted in OrbitDB or IPFS.

The sender node retains a bounded in-memory delivery until the recipient
acknowledges it or its 20-second TTL expires. It republishes the signal after
1, 2, 4 and 8 seconds. Every attempt has a new domain event id but retains the
same `signalId`, allowing recipients to acknowledge duplicates without
applying SDP or ICE twice.

Signal event attributes are:

```json
{
  "attempt": 1,
  "callId": "<callId>",
  "expiresAt": 1770000020000,
  "networkId": "<networkId>",
  "ownerNodeId": "<nodeId>",
  "participantIds": ["<senderIdentityId>", "<recipientIdentityId>"],
  "payload": {},
  "recipientIdentityId": "<recipientIdentityId>",
  "senderIdentityId": "<senderIdentityId>",
  "sentAt": 1770000000000,
  "signalId": "<signalId>",
  "signalType": "offer"
}
```

After successfully applying the signal, the recipient sends
`{"type":"call_signal_ack","signalId":"<signalId>"}` through its
authenticated WebSocket. Its node verifies that the authenticated identity is
the intended recipient and publishes `calls.v1.signal.acknowledged`:

```json
{
  "acknowledgedAt": 1770000000500,
  "callId": "<callId>",
  "networkId": "<networkId>",
  "ownerNodeId": "<senderNodeId>",
  "recipientIdentityId": "<recipientIdentityId>",
  "senderIdentityId": "<senderIdentityId>",
  "signalId": "<signalId>"
}
```

Acknowledgements are internal node-to-node events and are not forwarded to
frontend WebSockets. If an acknowledgement is lost, the next signal retry
causes the frontend to acknowledge the same `signalId` again.
